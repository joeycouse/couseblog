We always need gov’t reps to hold the teleworkers, Booz Allens, and Lockheeds accountable and ensure they do what we pay them for. Often this involves meetings, upon meetings, upon meetings. Though, civilians do manage and lead projects, active duty seems to be preferred due to the whole UCMJ thing, especially in high profile projects. Inevitably, this means there is a lieutenant somewhere managing their team of Booz Allen Contractors to gain leadership experience. \n\nThe Air Force is deeply confused. They love the fact that people will get PhDs and even try to incorporate it in promotions (recently), but have no idea how to utilize them. We love our officers to be highly educated technical experts but also want them to be commanders and leaders. There isn’t an IC (individual contributor) track, this is unlike industry where you can rise high within the company as an applied scientist/researcher. In my opinion, nearly all highly technical work is outsourced to the massive list of defense contractors. We as the gov’t reps are left to manage them, and get back products that we don’t understand and aren’t compatible with our existing systems. \n\nWe need to decide what our identity is. Are we really highly technical experts in machine learning, statistics, and computer science? Or are we people leaders and commanders? We can’t have both at once. We either support our own internal technical talent instead of sourcing more and more contractors or give in and rename the career field ‘Technical Program Manger’. \n\nAn idea, to fix some of these issues is to have two tracks: Manager and Tech Lead. New accession would take the first 4 years or so to learn the career field and the Air Force, and at some point should decide if they want to go to the manager track with education focusing on MBA type programs or go into the technical track with focus on Masters and PhD's in technical areas. Ideally, the career opportunities would align with this distinction and we wouldn't have to have a one-size-fits-all approach to a officer's career in a technical field. Not everyone wants to be a commander or director, sometimes people just want to learn and write high quality code and that opportunity should exist. \n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](middle_manager.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=300}\n\nOfficers are leaders, and being a good officer means being a good leader.
