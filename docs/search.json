    "text": "Officers are leaders, and being a good officer means being a good leader. This is the standard gospel for young military officers. However, this mindset is fundamentally incompatible with highly specialized and technical career fields. I believe much of this mentality is ingrained in our history. Our greatest military leaders led in combat not on the keyboard. Apple TV doesn’t release a new series about Air Force Operations Research Analysts.\nThis mentality fundamentally encourages young officers to be leaders of people, teams, and projects. Not become true technical experts. Lieutenants quickly become project managers, as ‘Leadership’ experience. It’s absurd that we have Lieutenants in highly technical career fields immediately becoming program managers, instead of learning and mastering their field. Being a middle level manager is an exhuasting balancing act, with a very limit scope of power and influence. You are constantly stuck between a rock and hard place, wanting to provide meaningful work to your suboridnates but being hamstrung by factors outside of your control. The Harvard Burliness Review has a great article on the struggle of being in this position. Unfortunately in a DoD bloated with civilians and contractors, the uniformed officers tend to be managers by default. I honestly couldn’t put my finger on why this is the case. My best guess is along two lines:\n\nIt helps JMO’s Career\n\nFor OPRs/OPBs being a leader of a 7 person team and managing 12 projects sounds a lot better than a someone who wrote Pyspark to combine, normalize, and merge 5 tables.\nOur leaders don’t understand what good technical work is. It’s impossible for the Colonels and Generals of the Air Force to determine the difference betweena Capt who made a linear regression model in Excel and Lieutenant who pre-trained a C++ implementation Llama2 from scratch. Both OPR bullets will read:\n“Adv’d AI/ML Adoption; developed custom AI solution; Saved $999 Billion dollars and 482 Million Man Hours; Tech Expert; promote now.”\n\nWe don’t trust anyone else\n\nWith the bloated sea of civilians and contractors, there aren’t much better options. We always need gov’t reps to hold the teleworkers, Booz Allens, and Lockheeds accountable and ensure they do what we pay them for. Often this involves meetings, upon meetings, upon meetings. Though, civilians do manage and lead projects, active duty seems to be preferred due to the whole UCMJ thing, especially in high profile projects. Inevitably, this means there is a lieutenant somewhere managing their team of Booz Allen Contractors to gain leadership experience.\nThe Air Force is deeply confused. They love the fact that people will get PhDs and even try to incorporate it in promotions (recently), but have no idea how to utilize them. We love our officers to be highly educated technical experts but also want them to be commanders and leaders. There isn’t an IC (individual contributor) track, this is unlike industry where you can rise high within the company as an applied scientist/researcher. In my opinion, nearly all highly technical work is outsourced to the massive list of defense contractors. We as the gov’t reps are left to manage them, and get back products that we don’t understand and aren’t compatible with our existing systems.\nWe need to decide what our identity is. Are we really highly technical experts in machine learning, statistics, and computer science? Or are we people leaders and commanders? We can’t have both at once. We either support our own internal technical talent instead of sourcing more and more contractors or give in and rename the career field ‘Technical Program Manger’.\nAn idea, to fix some of these issues is to have two tracks: Manager and Tech Lead. New accession would take the first 4 years or so to learn the career field and the Air Force, and at some point should decide if they want to go to the manager track with education focusing on MBA type programs or go into the technical track with focus on Masters and PhD’s in technical areas. Ideally, the career opportunities would align with this distinction and we wouldn’t have to have a one-size-fits-all approach to a officer’s career in a technical field. Not everyone wants to be a commander or director, sometimes people just want to learn and write high quality code and that opportunity should exist."

    "text": "For me transitioning from the Air Force is a bittersweet moment, being blessed with an amazing education and stable income (and a 2.25% Covid-era mortgage) has made life easier for me and my wife than most, and for that I’m truly grateful. But ultimately I decided it was best for me and my young family to transition to the private-sector, and with that comes a certain freedom to post your opinion on the internet without the fear that your next assignment will be at Minot AFB.\nI wanted to share my experience as a junior military officer (JMO) in a technical career field and discuss my frustrations and successes and give my very unqualified opinion on how things should change.\nI’ll be breaking this down into a series with key-themes:\n\nAccess to high-quality software and infrastructure\nBecoming a middle-level manager (The good and the bad)\nCompelling work and leadership that understands technology\nFinal thoughts and what’s next for me\n\nThe first thing that immediately frustrated me when coming on to my first (and only) active-duty assignment, was the lack of quality software, infrastructure, and data. Procuring basic freeware (R, Python, PowerBI, etc) became an enormous burden of scanning through every U.S. gov’t agencies’ software approval site for a letter that an important person signed that allowed you to do your job. Not to mention access to the myriad of different sites requires four-different signatures, and setting a 27 digit username and password that expires every 5 days. Anyone who has worked on getting basic software installed on a gov’t computer knows this pain. Not to mention the non-sense way the AF makes you track the number of “licenses” you can have for free-ware. Worst of all, the people with the admin-rights to install software aren’t even military or civilian employees, but random contractors that have no interest ensuring you have the software you need to do your job, but instead actively resist at all cost to protect against any perceived risk.\nWe have to do better, and regularly review and approve new software so our people can be the most effective and productive scientists, and not be stuck with versions of 5-7 year old software. Additionally, we need to ensure our people have access to recent packages and libraries that make life easier, which is often it’s own problem. Dependency management is an absolute nightmare in and the “It works on my computer” problem is persistent across anyone programming or using software in the Air Force.\nSoftware, however, is just one piece of the picture. We need the digital infrastructure to move products off of personal laptops and into cloud environments where they can be easily run and shared. Having built a variety of simple apps, dashboards, and the like it’s always been a nightmare to share and run apps. Between find a hosting platform and getting the required licenses it’s incredibly frustrating and prevents insights from getting into the hands of the decision makers that need them. Though the Air Force has made some improvements in this regard, the systems are less than user-friendly and suffer from the same software issues as above (e.g. building app with R 4.1 but the cloud only runs 3.6). The current analytic cloud platform of choice for the AF is a Palantir Foundry instance, however it encourages heavy use of their own built-in apps with point and click GUI interfaces. Almost everything is abstracted away behind settings, drop-downs, and menus. As a result, we teach our people how to make simple bar graphs in a proprietary software, not true analytic skills. Not to mention the mess of access control that prevents our own active-duty people from accessing the data they need. This is not inspiring work for our analysts, whom are often way over-qualified to be building dashboards with simple summary statistics.\nThe Air Force often broadcasts the need to develop advanced AI technology, but fundamentally lacks the software and infrastructure to do so. We have incredibly talented and smart people among our ranks but we don’t give them to tools to be successful or to create meaningful products and analysis. There’s no place to put a docker container for a model API, or a means to train a deep-learning model with GPUs. We are stuck with boring reports, slide-decks, or a glorified bar-graph dashboard. We can and need to do better, our people are capable of much more. Stay tuned for my next topic - becoming a middle-level manager.\n(BTW I had originally intended to include data in this topic, but in short it’s a complete mess of stovepipes and silos)."

    "text": "A wise analyst once said “data science is 99% counting things, and sometimes dividing”.\nWhenever I hear about AI or deep learning in the AF, I can’t help but roll my eyes. Those are at the top of the pyramid! Developing, deploying, and maintaining advanced models must build on a extremely strong and robust lower level data cleaning, aggregation, and pipe-lining. Although, flashy and enticing we aren’t ready for AI in the AF.\nIMO large investments must be made in the boring stuff. Database management and integration - cloud storage and process consolidation. Navigating 10+ disconnected and individually contracted database systems is not realistically manageable. Not doing the boring stuff right has a negative effect on our ability to observe, orient, and decide. Furthermore, it doesn’t seem that any of these contractors have any incentive to collaborate. Consolidation means loss of business.\nBefore, we jump the gun to AI. We need to glimpse() and summarise() what we already have. We need to deepen our knowledge of our current processes - we can’t optimize what we don’t understand. Which brings me back to my first point - counting. The easiest and often greatest insights into a process are usually the result of a simple count.\n\nHow many people are doing xyz?\nHow many times is xyz done per month?\nHow often does xyz happen?\netc.\n\nGraduating from USAFA and serving in the Air Force are among my greatest life accomplishments, and I desperately want to contribute to this country which has truly blessed me and my family with opportunity. But I’ll admit, I question if this is best way and every time I read a headline to the tune of “How the Air Force is using AI to …” I feel that much more disconnected from the larger organization.\nThe gov’t and military have the most motivating challenges for any data scientist. Your work directly contributes to the safety and security of our nation, not to the pockets of shareholders. I believe younger generations feel more obligated to serve in roles that benefit society, and the public sector has the strongest pitch. But we need to be empowered - data is the present and future – can we get a handle on ours?"
